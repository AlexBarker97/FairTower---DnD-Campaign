Competitive element of the tower, eliminations mean points, points mean currency outside of combat?
Spell slots, ammo, health all reset between portal resets.
Communication between nations over the month before training - All nations seem to have agreed not to divulge information until members are at the training camp.
This world could be consideded a utopia, there is universal healthcare, people live long and well. Unemployment is almost non-existent and petty crimes are all vut eradicated. People's jobs don't earn them pay, they directly give them access to a selection of houses, cars, holiday packages for their job "bracket". Everyone is paid the same amount outside of these job based benefits.
The economy is extrodinarily healthy and the government fully control it all seemingly well.
Plot twist spoiler: The government is pumping this money currently into technology toberadicate and terraform other nearby planets quietly. This is what the playwrs fight in the portal dimensions. And mandatory traininf ia required as the gov has realised assaulting these nearby planets may bring retaliation.
Training to join the "People's Guard"
Guards on floors which keep you from entering a floor you have not yet unlocked.
People you have met coming back from the training have been fairly underwhelmed and have just told you you will see when you get there.

In some trail rooms you begin by stepping through stretched paste and falling into water (portal into another dimension) where you can fight monsters 
Con save + portal proficiency dice roll each dimension shift to find out what side-effefts you experience 
Shifting pools to meditate in between levels, if the party wanta to train their portal proficiency 

Futuristic civilisation on a new planet that they fled to, to avoid self-destruction through war.
This new planetary civilisation has achieved peace and held it for 100+ years now.
The civilisation is broken up into hundreds of nations co-existing. These all have a mix of almost all races.

Without much explanation across the nation, 5 days of mandatory training is required for all in adulthood (whatever that is for the race, Humans 18+ etc...).
Nobody is told the purpose or knows if other nations are also required to do so.

Multiple training camps across the nation spring up and the players recieve mail inviting them to attend, for one reason or another all players avoid this invite for the first month before they are threatened. (Up to the players creativity of why they delayed and what they would be threatened with).
The players all turn up at a training camp named "Fairtower". A tiresome 5 floor building, very boring and mundane from the outside, surrounded by temporary accomodation.

As the players progress each day they go up a floor.
Levels of the tower should be conquered 1/day if successful in the training tasks.
Players are given a stimulant to multiply their training rate allowing them to pick up new skills and stay in a heightened state for long periods.

The camp: Fairly full, enough accomodation for maybe 400 people by eye, very newly built with plenty of food, drink and utilities heavily subsidised.
