Bad things: 
- Orphaned at only 1 year old (Tortle thing, parents have babies at the end of their lives)
- natural distrust of birds (birds eat Tortle babies)
- Doesn't like large bodies of water, was stranded at sea for 5 days when a boat he was on sank, survived only due to his natural buoyancy and ability to hold breath for over an hour.

Extremely bad thing:
- One night poachers tried to kill him for his shell, while hiding in his shell feeling the poachers tools pry and pick at him the moonlight cut through the clouds and landing on him. Feeling the power of the moon imbue him he was able to bring down a powerful beam of light (moonbeam) to kill the poachers. Using this as the awakening of his cleric powers and sending him on his journey to learn about his lunar god.

Good things:
- Moonlight has always guided him out of trouble in difficult times
- A gnome (Gneil, pronounced guh-neil) was the only other survivor of the shipwreck where he was stranded at sea. He was small enough to use Armando as a sort of boat. The two formed a great bond and became very close friends through this ordeal. Armando has a very positive view of gnomes.
- Always been curious and explorative, enjoys taking the party less trodden. Somehow never seems to get lost

Very good things:
- the wonder he experienced seeing the world after leaving his community to wander the world
- He has fond memories of his Tortle community when his parents were alive
