Unarmed Fighting. 
Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit.
If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.
At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.
