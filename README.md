# TowerIdea

A bit magical/cyberpunky of a world, futuristic civilisation on a new planet that they fled to, to avoid self-destruction through war.
This new planetary civilisation has achieved peace and held it for 100+ years now, there is still violence, petty crimes and democratic unrest but is largely peaceful with no wars to be found. The civilisation is broken up into hundreds of nations co-existing. These all have a mix of almost all races.

Without much explanation across the nation, 5 days of mandatory training is required for all ages above scalar 2years (each race has multiplier on this for maturity (Humans 9x (18 years)). Nobody is quite sure of the purpose or if other nations are also required to do so.

Multiple training camps across the nation, the players all turn up at one named "Fairtower". Simple 5 floor tall building, very boring and mundane from the outside. As the players progress each day they go up a floor.

(First 5 levels of the tower, can be conquered 1 day each if successful on each)
Players given a stimulant to multiply their training rate (allowing them to achieve 1 level per day)

Floor 1: The welcome floor
Simple 1 on 1 combat vs simulation/hologram target dummies. Players will get to know the other npc's at this entry point. Get to know eachother, small level 1 combat. (they will get babied through this)

Floor 2: Duet
Paired up with partners (chosen by players) (could be npc or other players) (these will not be permenant partners but will be good to get players invested in some NPCs)

Floor 3: Liberation
Specific challenges for each player, designed to specialise them (class features)

Floor 4: Team working
Finally get to form their own group (likely the party of player characters)
The nation is fixated on the most optimal squad size being (Party number +1)

Floor 5: The exam
They are given written tests which seem impossibly hard
As they get questions wrong the examiners become more and more angry
Examiners innevitably become aggressive and you must fight them (they turn out to be holograms and defeating them is the final test)

Fairtower - myths and whispers of why it is named this

After the exam they are approached by someone who has noticed their aptitude and lets them know that they have the option to trial for higher ranking positions (but they would have to enter as a squad). It is not at all clear what ranking this would be in as there is no military to be ranked in.

If they accept, floor 6 begins (Floor-1) and the challenges begin to go down deeper underground 1 floor at a time.
