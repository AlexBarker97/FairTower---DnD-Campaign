# "DnD Fairtower - The descent"

Plotholes -

• Communication between nations over the month before training?
• How were the people on the new world selected and where did they come from (why did they leave).
• How is the government enforcing the enrolment.
• How does the political system work.
• Have people heard different rumours as to why the training is happening.
• Technology time period
• How common is magic in the world (almost non-existent day to day)
• Proportions of different races in the world, which are included and which are excluded?
• Time period and technology available


Details:
This world could be consideded a utopia, there is universal healthcare, people live long and well. Unemployment is almost non-existent and petty crimes are all vut eradicated. People's jobs don't earn them pay, they directly give them access to a selection of houses, cars, holiday packages for their job "bracket". Everyone is paid the same amount outside of these job based benefits.
The economy is extrodinarily healthy and the government fully control it all seemingly well.
Plot twist spoiler: The government is pumping this money currently into technology toberadicate and terraform other nearby planets quietly. This is what the playwrs fight in the portal dimensions. And mandatory traininf ia required as the gov has realised assaulting these nearby planets may bring retaliation.
Training to join the "People's Guard"
Guards on floors which keep you from entering a floor you have not yet unlocked.
People you have met coming back from the training have been fairly underwhelmed and have just told you you will see when you get there.

In some trail rooms you begin by stepping through stretched paste and falling into water (portal into another dimension) where you can fight monsters 
Con save + portal proficiency dice roll each dimension shift to find out what side-effefts you experience 
Shifting pools to meditate in between levels, if the party wanta to train their portal proficiency 

Futuristic civilisation on a new planet that they fled to, to avoid self-destruction through war.
This new planetary civilisation has achieved peace and held it for 100+ years now.
The civilisation is broken up into hundreds of nations co-existing. These all have a mix of almost all races.

Without much explanation across the nation, 5 days of mandatory training is required for all in adulthood (whatever that is for the race, Humans 18+ etc...).
Nobody is told the purpose or knows if other nations are also required to do so.

Multiple training camps across the nation spring up and the players recieve mail inviting them to attend, for one reason or another all players avoid this invite for the first month before they are threatened. (Up to the players creativity of why they delayed and what they would be threatened with).
The players all turn up at a training camp named "Fairtower". A tiresome 5 floor building, very boring and mundane from the outside, surrounded by temporary accomodation.

As the players progress each day they go up a floor.
Levels of the tower should be conquered 1/day if successful in the training tasks.
Players are given a stimulant to multiply their training rate allowing them to pick up new skills and stay in a heightened state for long periods.

The camp: Fairly full, enough accomodation for maybe 400 people by eye, very newly built with plenty of food, drink and utilities heavily subsidised.

Floor 1: "The welcome floor"
Introduction key points; It has come to the attention of the universal committee that very few people on the planet would be even able to defend given a hostile force. They have proposed a baseline of ability for every member of the planet to be learnt at maturity. There are 200 people here today, you will be fed, and looked after. Nobody has failed floor 1.

On the Maybe 200 people of all races and ages gathering in the welcome floor. All are very new to this, nobody has failed floor 1 and been asked to re-do it.
Simple 1 on 1 combat vs simulation/hologram target dummies. Players will get to know the other npc's at this entry point. Get to know eachother, small level 1 combat. (they will get babied through this)

Floor 2: "Duet"
Paired up with partners (chosen by players) (could be npc or other players) (these will not be permenant partners but will be good to get players invested in some NPCs)
Perhaps the party can meet one or two people who have failed the duet amd meeded to re-do floor2? This is where they are introduced to the concept of potential failure. It is explained to them that if they fail in the evening, they get to attempt to redo it the next morning to not fall behind.

Floor 3: "Liberation"
Specific challenges for each player, designed to specialise them (class features)

Floor 4: "Team working"
Finally get to form their own group (likely the party of player characters)
The nation is fixated on the most optimal squad size being (Party number +1)
Some are deliberately failing this level to be able to spend more time living cheaply and well in the subsidised camp.

Floor 5: "The exam"
They are given written tests which seem impossibly hard
As they get questions wrong the examiners become more and more angry
Examiners innevitably become aggressive and you must fight them (they turn out to be holograms and defeating them is the final test)

Fairtower - myths and whispers of why it is named this

After the exam they are approached by someone who has noticed their aptitude and lets them know that they have the option to trial for higher ranking positions (but they would have to enter as a squad). It is not at all clear what ranking this would be in as there is no military to be ranked in.

If they accept, floor 6 begins (Floor-1) and the challenges begin to go down deeper underground 1 floor at a time.
