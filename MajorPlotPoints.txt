MOTIVATION to keep progressing the story:
Session 1-5	- Mandatory, learning the ropes above round, curiosity, learning characters
Level 5 End of exam introduced to Zoltar and his aura of malice
6-8	- New world, Understanding malice going on, ADDICTION Stamin-X, competing, corsair sighting
Level 8-12 monsters get more cunning, they start playing on party weakness
9-10 - Corsairs, Near death exp, 
level 14+ invasion comes/saving the world (Idyll)

Lategame (14+)
Battle with Zoltar?
Battle for Drakorin?
A cure for Stamin-X?
Taking over fairtower?


Once the People's guild realised they are going to be attacked they doubled down trying to exterminate the planet named Drakorin


Players addiction to Stamin-X
Exhaustion gains for every day they don't take it (resets almost the moment that they do)


Enemies begin mimicking the players and they have to fight their shadow equivalents?
